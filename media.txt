When it was young, the Sun was surrounded by a dense disk of gas and dust, and it was
from this disk the Solar System formed. Our work presents a decade of observations of
another star at a similar stage, which is oriented such that star-sized clumps of dust in
this disk pass in front of the star, and sometimes block it completely. Despite our best
efforts, the origin of these clumps remains unclear. They could simply be turbulent
fluctuations in the disk, or be clouds of fragments resulting from collisions between
orbiting asteroids.

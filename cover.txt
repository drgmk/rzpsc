Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the original article, titled "The transiting dust clumps in the
evolved disk of the Sun-like UXOr RZ~Psc". It describes our analysis of a decade of
observations of an unusual variable star, and our interpretation of this system.

I have one technical comment regarding the latex style file that should be passed on to
the appropriate person; using the \ref command on subsections yields text like "(a)", but
no information about which section this subsection belongs to. That is, "(a)" could be
section 1a, 2a, etc.

regards
Grant Kennedy

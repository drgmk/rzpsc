# RZ Psc

RZ Psc is a young Sun-like star, long associated with the UXor class of variable stars,
which is partially or wholly dimmed by dust clumps several times each year. The system
has a bright and variable infrared excess, which has been interpreted as evidence that
the dimming events are the passage of asteroidal fragments in front of the host
star. Here, we present a decade of optical photometry of RZ Psc and take a critical look
at the asteroid belt interpretation. We show that the distribution of light curve
gradients is non-uniform for deep events, which we interpret as possible evidence for an
asteroidal fragment-like clump structure. However, the clumps are very likely seen above
a high optical depth mid-plane, so the disk's bulk clumpiness is not revealed. While
circumstantial evidence suggests an asteroid belt is more plausible than a gas-rich
transition disk, the evolutionary status remains uncertain. We suggest that the rarity of
Sun-like stars showing disk-related variability may arise because i) any accretion
streams are transparent, and/or ii) turbulence above the inner rim is normally shadowed
by a flared outer disk.
  
This repository contains nearly everything used in the analysis upon which this paper is
based. The main thing missing will be IDL *.pro files for subroutines, most of which can
be found in the NASA IDL library. I am happy to supply any others.

The compiled normalised light curve is in the file "figs/all-lc.txt".
